ANAGRAM FINDER



1. ASSIGN TO EVERY WORD IN DICT THEIR CORRESPONDING KEY

	KEY: the word with its characters in sorted alphabetical order

	e.g.:

		aardvark -- aaadkrrv
		bobcat -- abbcot
		pots -- opst
		spot -- opst
		opts -- opst
		tops -- opst

2. Sort the list based on keys

	-- this will put all anagram classes next to each other

3. Determine the anagram classes

	-- we need to delimit anagram classes simply by scanning the new 
	list and keeping track of the previous key.

	-- once we see a new key, we're in a new anagram class
